## 10/18/2025 - Set up/brainstormed project.  

started blueprint today!
i'm so excited, since i was too late to join the summer of hack project ;_;

after learning about this project, i started to brainstorm about what i could build for this project, and developed the idea of the R.A.P.!

the R.A.P. stands for retro audio player, i was heavily inspired by the sony walkman, i really wanted to have a retro music player like that, especially seeing aesthetics of other "old" 2000s mp3/cassette/dvd players

but the problem with the sony walkman is that it uses cassettes, so i would need each indivduial song to be able to listen on it, and i wouldn't be able to listen to obcscure artists (which is my entire taste ;_;)

so i decided to make something new that uses spotify (or files), bluetooth, and maybe touchscreen, but still have a satisfying feel of physical buttons and feel solid in your hands

ive dropped some pics below of what i would be basing of/inspo! :)

## 10/19/2025 - designed project/List of parts and materials  

the features i wanted for this project was:
-bluetooth connectivity
-sd card slot
-physical buttons
-ability to connect to spotify
-(new) front should be able to open like a walkman, but is optional
-im hoping for the design to be able to be metal on the outside to feel heavy, but if not possible, i'll settle for a transparent or yellow 3D printed case.

from the features, here are some obvious parts that i think i need for now:
-bluetooth module
-sd card reader writer module
-button modules
-im not sure yet what i'll use for the actual board thats running everything, whether it be arduino or raspberry pi or anything else, but i'll find a way to configure spotify or a streamer.
-i'll develop a mechanism to open and close the front using metal or plastic
-after making a sketch then a model, i'll be able to see what printers i can use to either carve out a metal frame or just 3d print a case but paint it yellow or make it have an clear look using resin.

attached below is some of the stuff i researched online and took inspo!
