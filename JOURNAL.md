## 10/18/2025 - Set up/brainstormed project.  

started blueprint today!
i'm so excited, since i was too late to join the summer of hack project ;_;

after learning about this project, i started to brainstorm about what i could build for this project, and developed the idea of the R.A.P.!

the R.A.P. stands for retro audio player, i was heavily inspired by the sony walkman, i really wanted to have a retro music player like that, especially seeing aesthetics of other "old" 2000s mp3/cassette/dvd players

but the problem with the sony walkman is that it uses cassettes, so i would need each indivduial song to be able to listen on it, and i wouldn't be able to listen to obcscure artists (which is my entire taste ;_;)

so i decided to make something new that uses spotify (or files), bluetooth, and maybe touchscreen, but still have a satisfying feel of physical buttons and feel good and heavy in your hands/be aesthetic.

ive dropped some pics below of what i would be basing of/inspo! :) (color of it might be yellow???)
